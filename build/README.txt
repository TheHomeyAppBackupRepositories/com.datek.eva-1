Support for Eva Smart Home devices.

Eva Smart Plug
With Eva Smart Plug you have one of the smallest 16A smartplugs in the market. 
Use it to control lights, heating devices, chargers and more. 
You can set it in timer mode so it will never be on more than a preset amount of minutes. 
The plug measures resistive current load, with an accuracy of +/- 5 % on currents above 1 Amp.

Eva Meter Reader
Eva Meter Reader makes your Meter Reader smart! 
The meter reader easily connects to the HAN-port of your modern AMS-meter reader that you can find in your fuse box. 
This way you can collect real time data and get a full overview of your consumption - directly to your smart home system. 

Eva Scene Selector
Eva Scene Selector makes it easy to create the perfect mood or scenario in your smart house. 
The Scene Selector offers up to 12 programmable buttons that you can use to activate your favorite flows in the Homey App. 


The app will be continiously developed with support for more Eva Smart Home devices.
